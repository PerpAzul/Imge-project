Hello, Thank you for purchasing the Ultimate Vending Machine Pack!


Use these assets to populate an environment. 

*******Prefabs********
Vending Machine A - Specular material, suited for mobile
Vending Machine A Illuminated - Uses a self illumination texture, looks awesome when lightmapped. Suited for dark/interior environments.

Can A - Uses a reflective material
Can A (Physics) - Same as Can A but has a box collider and rigidbody. 


If you want the vending machines to be moveable in-game then make sure to uncheck static on the prefab. The vending machine prefabs have been marked as static to improve performance and allow light mapping.


********Demo Scenes********
2 demo scenes included, one shows the specular vending machine whilst the other shows illuminated lightmapped vending machine. (Press play and the camera will move around the scene)


********PSD Files********
The PSD files are included if you wish to create your own brands of drinks. The PSD's are organised so that it is easy and logical to adapt parts of the texture. They can be found in the materials folder "Can Textures 1024x1024" and "Vending Machine Textures 1024x1024"


********Performance Considerations********
The drinks cans will batch using dynamic batching.
Vending Machine - 536 Tris
Drinks Can - 126 Tris




Happy Vending!
